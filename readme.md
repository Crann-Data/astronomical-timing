# Astronomical timing

Generate a dataset for solar cycles.

TODO:
- [ ] Format time properly. Currently the time is produced as a datetime format, this needs to have the date removed from it, however, pandas was giving issues with this.
- [ ] Add CLI args parsing for lookback
- [ ] Add the moon cycles
